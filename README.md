# MSP
CCS Project to read the data from 8 ADC inputs using DMA

Matlab Script to generate .h file where DMA tasks are defined

Use  MSP432_DMA_MULTI7 and GENERADOR_DMA_MSP432_2   

MSP432 has a limited memory, that is why it is not possible to obtain more than 512 samples per ADC channel if 8 ADC inputs are enabled
